# An Empirical Study on the Impact of Gender Diversity on Code Quality in AI Systems

### Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI systems necessitates high-quality, sustainable code to ensure reliability and mitigate risks such as bias and technical debt. However, the underrepresentation of women in software engineering raises concerns about homogeneity in AI development. Studying gender diversity in AI systems in crucial, as diverse perspectives are essential for improving system robustness, reducing bias and enhancing overall code quality. While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of diversity in general software teams, its specific impact on AI code quality remains unexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how gender diversity within AI teams influences project popularity, code quality (e.g., vulnerabilities, complexity), and individual contributions. Our study makes three key contributions. First, we analyzed the relationship between team diversity and repository popularity, revealing that diverse AI repositories not only differ significantly from non-diverse ones but also achieve higher popularity and greater community engagement. Second, we explored the effect of diversity on the overall code quality of AI systems and found that diverse repositories tend to have superior code quality compared to non-diverse ones. Finally, our analysis of individual contributions revealed that although female contributions contribute to a smaller proportion of the total code, their contributions demonstrate consistently higher quality than those of their male counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of addressing barriers to female participation in AI development, as fostering diversity can enhance the quality, reliability, and overall success of AI systems.
